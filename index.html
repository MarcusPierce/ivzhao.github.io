                <p>I always want to be a professor, pushing the frontiers of cognitive science. But it didn’t took me long to realize that I would be poor in either case, and busy writing research grants.</p>
                <p>Then I found my salvation in programming. With insights and asetheics, a programmer is closest; the entire Internet poplation could be her research subjects. However, I also realize you still need to make a name for yourself, street credit - that’s what people call it. Hence you are reading my portfolio right now.</p>
                <p>My design philosophy is simple: legibility triumphs everything. It doesn’t have to be minimal (our human vision system is designed for complex, messy world), the key is in effective cummnication. How to most effectively transfer the informatin from pixels to views memory.</p>
                <p>The same philosophy applies to my codes.</p>
                <p>I am in my mid 20s. Born and raised in China, and currently lives in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
